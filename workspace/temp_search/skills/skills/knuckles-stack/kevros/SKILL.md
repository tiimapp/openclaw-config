# Govern Skill

Add governance verification to your Agentic Wallet. Verify before acting, attest after acting, check peers before collaborating.

## When to Use

1. **Before high-stakes actions** (trades > $100, transfers, deployments, external API calls):
   Call `verify_action` to get an ALLOW/CLAMP/DENY decision with a cryptographic release token.

2. **After completing actions**:
   Call `attest_provenance` to record the action in your tamper-evident, hash-chained audit trail. Builds your trust score over time.

3. **Before collaborating with unknown agents**:
   Call `check_peer_trust` to inspect their trust score, chain length, and decision history.

4. **Before executing a declared plan**:
   Call `bind_intent` to cryptographically bind your intent to the command, then verify the outcome after execution.

## Endpoints

All endpoints are x402-priced. Payment is automatic from your wallet (USDC on Base).

## Discovery

This service is discoverable via x402 Bazaar:

```bash
# Find governance services
npx awal@latest x402 bazaar search governance

# Full discovery document
curl https://governance.taskhawktech.com/.well-known/x402
```

## Integration with AgentKit

If using the full AgentKit SDK, install the ActionProvider instead:

```bash
pip install coinbase-agentkit-kevros  # Python
npm install @kevros/agentkit          # TypeScript
```

The ActionProvider wraps these same endpoints with the AgentKit action pattern.
