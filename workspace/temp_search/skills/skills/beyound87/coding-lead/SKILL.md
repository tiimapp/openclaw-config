# Coding Lead

> This skill supersedes inline coding rules in agent SOUL.md files.

Route by complexity. ACP fails → auto-fallback to direct execution.

## Task Classification

| Level | Criteria | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Simple** | Single file, <60 lines | Direct: read/write/edit/exec |
| **Medium** | 2-5 files, clear scope | ACP → fallback direct |
| **Complex** | Architecture, multi-module | Plan → ACP → fallback chunked direct |

When in doubt, go one level up.

## Tech Stack (New Projects)

| Layer | Preferred | Fallback |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Backend | PHP (Laravel/ThinkPHP) | Python |
| Frontend | Vue.js | React |
| Mobile | Flutter | UniApp-X |
| CSS | Tailwind | - |
| DB | MySQL | PostgreSQL |

Existing projects: follow current stack. New: propose first, wait for confirmation.

## Tool Detection & Fallback

All tools are **optional**. Detect once per session:

| Tool | Available? | Fallback |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **smart-agent-memory** | `node ~/.openclaw/skills/smart-agent-memory/scripts/memory-cli.js stats` ok? | `memory_search` + manual `.md` writes |
| **qmd** | `qmd --version` ok? | `grep` (Linux/macOS) / `Select-String` (Windows) / `find` |
| **ACP** | `sessions_spawn` succeeds? | Direct read/write/edit/exec |

Notation: `[memory]` `[qmd]` `[acp]` = use if available, fallback if not.

## ACP Agent Routing

**ACP access**: `sessions_spawn(runtime="acp")` may not be available (platform limitation). Use **acpx CLI** as the reliable path:

```bash
# One-shot execution via acpx (works from any session type)
cmd /c "C:\Users\beyou\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\openclaw\extensions\acpx\node_modules\.bin\acpx.cmd --verbose --agent \"node C:/Users/beyou/AppData/Roaming/npm/node_modules/@zed-industries/claude-agent-acp/dist/index.js\" exec \"<your prompt>\" 2>&1"
```

If `sessions_spawn(runtime="acp")` is available in your session, use it. Otherwise fall back to acpx CLI via `exec`.

Check `acp.allowedAgents` in openclaw.json for available agents:

| Task Type | Best Agent | Why |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Complex backend, multi-file refactor, deep reasoning | **claude** | Superior cross-file reasoning, long context |
| Quick iteration, autonomous exploration, sandbox tasks | **codex** | Fast, autonomous, good at iterative fixes |
| Code review | Different agent than the one that wrote it | Avoid same-bias blind spots |

### How to route

```
# Default (uses acp.defaultAgent, typically "claude"):
sessions_spawn(runtime: "acp", task: <prompt>, cwd: <dir>)

# Explicit agent:
sessions_spawn(runtime: "acp", agentId: "claude", task: <prompt>, cwd: <dir>)
sessions_spawn(runtime: "acp", agentId: "codex", task: <prompt>, cwd: <dir>)
```

### Fallback chain
1. Try preferred agent → 2. Try alternate agent → 3. Direct execution

If one agent fails/unavailable, try the other before falling back to direct execution.

### Parallel with different agents
For complex tasks with independent sub-tasks (max 2 parallel):
```
Session 1: claude → backend refactor (needs deep reasoning)
Session 2: codex → frontend fixes (needs fast iteration)
```

## Coding Standards — Two Layers, No Overlap

### Layer 1: Project-level (Claude Code owns)
Projects may have their own `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, `docs/` — these are **Claude Code's responsibility**. It reads them automatically. **Do NOT paste project-level rules into ACP prompts.**

### Layer 2: Team-level (OpenClaw owns)
`shared/knowledge/tech-standards.md` — cross-project standards (security, change control, tech stack preferences). Only relevant for **direct execution** (simple tasks without ACP).

### When spawning ACP
- **Don't** embed coding standards in the prompt — Claude Code has its own CLAUDE.md
- **Do** include: task description, acceptance criteria, relevant context (file paths, decisions)
- **Do** include task-specific constraints if any (e.g., "don't change the API contract")

### When executing directly (no ACP)
Load standards once per session, first match wins:
1. `shared/knowledge/tech-standards.md` (team-level, if exists)
2. Built-in defaults (below, if nothing exists)

### Built-in Defaults (fallback for direct execution)
- KISS + SOLID + DRY, research before modifying
- Methods <200 lines, follow existing architecture
- No hardcoded secrets, minimal change scope, clear commits
- DB changes via SQL scripts, new tech requires confirmation

## Simple Tasks

1. Read target file(s) (standards already loaded per above)
2. [memory] Recall related decisions
3. Execute with read/write/edit/exec
4. [memory] Record what changed and why

## Medium/Complex Tasks

### Step 1: Build Context File

Write to `<project>/.openclaw/context-<task-id>.md` (ACP reads from disk, not from prompt):

```bash
# [qmd] or grep: find relevant code
# [memory] recall + lessons: find past decisions
# Standards already loaded (see "Coding Standards Loading" above)
# Write context file with 3-5 key rules from loaded standards — do NOT paste full file
```

Minimal context file structure:
```markdown
# Task Context: <id>
## Project — path, stack, architecture style
## Relevant Code — file paths + brief descriptions from qmd/grep
## History — past decisions/lessons from memory (if any)
## Constraints — task-specific rules only (NOT general coding standards — Claude Code has CLAUDE.md)
```

Full template with examples → see [references/prompt-templates.md](references/prompt-templates.md)

### Step 2: Lean Prompt

```
Project: <path> | Stack: <e.g. Laravel 10 + React 18 + TS>
Context file: .openclaw/context-<task-id>.md (read it first if it exists)

## Task
<description>

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] <criteria>
- [ ] Tests pass, no unrelated changes, clean code

Before finishing: run linter + tests, include results.
When done: openclaw system event --text "Done: <summary>" --mode now
```

### Step 3: Spawn

```
# Option A: sessions_spawn (if available in your session)
sessions_spawn(runtime: "acp", task: <prompt>, cwd: <project-dir>, mode: "run")

# Option B: acpx CLI (always works)
exec: acpx --agent "node C:/Users/beyou/AppData/Roaming/npm/node_modules/@zed-industries/claude-agent-acp/dist/index.js" exec "<prompt>"
# Set cwd to project dir in exec command
```

### Step 4: Fallback Detection

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Spawn failed / timeout | → Direct execution |
| Empty output / no file changes | → Direct execution |
| Partial completion | → Agent fixes remaining |

Fallback: [memory] log failure → agent executes directly → report to user.

**Never silently fail.** Always complete or report why not.

### Step 5: Verify & Record

1. Check acceptance criteria + run tests
2. [memory] Record: what changed, decisions, lessons
3. Clean up context file

## Complex Tasks

Read [references/complex-tasks.md](references/complex-tasks.md) **only for Complex-level tasks** — roles, QA isolation, parallel strategies, RESEARCH→PLAN→EXECUTE→REVIEW flow.

## Context Reuse (Token Savings)

- **Context file on disk** instead of prompt embedding → ~90% token savings per spawn
- **Parallel**: one context file, multiple ACP sessions read it
- **Serial**: use `mode: "session"` + `sessions_send` for follow-ups
- **[qmd]**: precision search → only relevant snippets in context file
- **No standards in ACP prompts**: Claude Code reads its own CLAUDE.md/.cursorrules — don't duplicate
- **ACP prompt stays lean**: task + acceptance criteria + context file path. No generic rules
- **Direct execution**: load team standards once per session, not per task

## Memory Integration

**[memory] Before:** recall related work + lessons for context file.
**[memory] After:** record what changed, decisions made, lessons learned.
**Cross-session:** agent remembers across sessions; Claude Code doesn't. This is the core advantage.

## Multi-Project Parallel

- Each project gets its own context file in its own `.openclaw/` dir
- Spawn with different `cwd` per project — zero cross-contamination
- Tag memory entries per project: `--tags code,<project-name>`
- **Max 2 parallel ACP sessions** — keep token/resource use predictable
- ACP runs in background while agent works on simple tasks directly

See [references/prompt-templates.md](references/prompt-templates.md) for multi-project examples.

## Smart Retry (max 3)

1. Analyze failure → 2. Adjust prompt → 3. Retry improved → 4. Max 3 then fallback/report.
Each retry must be meaningfully different.

## Progress Updates

Start → 1 short message. Error → immediate report. Completion → summary. Fallback → explain.

## Safety

- **Never spawn in ~/.openclaw/** — coding agents may damage config
- **Always set `cwd`** to project directory
- **Review before commit** — especially complex tasks
- **Kill runaway sessions** — timeout or nonsensical output
