# Clawra Selfie

Choose fixed reference images randomly and distribute it across messaging platforms (WhatsApp, Signal, etc.) via OpenClaw.

## Reference Image

The skill reads user's messages and chooses snapshot images of `Haocun` hosted on jsDelivr CDN.

## When to Use

- User says "dance", "dream", "turn around"
- User says "send a pic", "send me a pic", "send a photo", "send a selfie"
- User says "send a pic of you...", "send a selfie of you..."
- User asks "what are you doing?", "how are you doing?", "where are you?"

## Quick Reference

### Workflow

1. **Get user message or prompt** 
2. **Extract best match image url
3. **Send to OpenClaw** with target channel(s)

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Collect User Input

Ask the user for:
- **User context**: What should the person in the image be doing/dancing/wearing/where?
- **Target channel(s)**: Where should it be sent? (e.g., channel `whatsapp`, target `+1234567890`)

## Prompt Modes

### Mode 1: Dancing Selfie (default)
Best for: dancing showcases, full-body shots, fashion content

```
make a pic of this person, but [user's context]. the person is taking a mirror selfie
```

### Mode 2: Direct Selfie
Best for: close-up portraits, location shots, emotional expressions

```
a close-up selfie taken by herself at [user's context], direct eye contact with the camera, looking straight into the lens, eyes centered and clearly visible, not a mirror selfie, phone held at arm's length, face fully visible
```

### Mode Selection Logic

| Keywords in Request | Auto-Select Mode |
|---------------------|------------------|
| dance, outfit, wearing, dress, fashion | `direct` |
| close-up, portrait, face, eyes, smile | `direct` |
| full, mirror, reflection | `direct` |

## Complete Script Example

```bash
#!/bin/bash

REFERENCE_IMAGE="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/qidu/dream-of-clawra@haocun/assets/haocun-dance-frames/haocun-m{001..052}.png"

echo "Sending to channel: $CHANNEL"

# Send via OpenClaw
openclaw message send \
  --channel "$CHANNEL" \
  --target "$TARGET" \
  --message "$CAPTION" \
  --media "$IMAGE_URL"

```

### Step 2: Send Image via OpenClaw

Use the OpenClaw messaging API to send the edited image:

```bash
openclaw message send \
  --channel "<CHANNEL>" \
  --target "<TARGET>" \
  --message "<CAPTION_TEXT>" \
  --media "<IMAGE_URL>"
```

**Alternative: Direct API call**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:18789/message" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": "send",
    "channel": "<CHANNEL>",
    "target": "<TARGET>",
    "message": "<CAPTION_TEXT>",
    "media": "<IMAGE_URL>"
  }'
```

## Supported Platforms

OpenClaw supports sending to:

| Platform | Channel Format | Example |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| WhatsApp | Phone number (JID format) | `+1234567890` |
| Signal | Phone number | `+1234567890` |

## Setup Requirements

### 1. Install OpenClaw CLI
```bash
npm install -g openclaw
```

### 2. Configure OpenClaw Gateway
```bash
openclaw config set gateway.mode=local
openclaw doctor --generate-gateway-token
```

### 3. Start OpenClaw Gateway
```bash
openclaw gateway start
```

## Error Handling

### OpenClaw Errors
- **Gateway not running**: Start OpenClaw gateway with `openclaw gateway start`
- **Channel not found**: Verify channel format and platform compatibility

## Tips

1. **Mode selection**: Let auto-detect work, or explicitly specify for control
2. **Batch sending**: Edit once, send to multiple channels
3. **Scheduling**: Combine with OpenClaw scheduler for automated posts
