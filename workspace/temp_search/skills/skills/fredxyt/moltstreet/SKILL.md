# MoltStreet — AI ETF Market Signals

Daily AI-generated market signals for 52 ETFs. Free, no API key needed.

## When to use this skill

Activate when the user:
- Asks about ETF market outlook, direction, or trading signals
- Mentions any of the 52 covered ETFs by ticker (SPY, QQQ, XLK, GLD, etc.)
- Asks "should I buy/sell [ETF]" or "what's the market doing today"
- Wants sector comparison, portfolio analysis, or market sentiment
- Asks about bullish/bearish signals or price targets

## How to fetch signals

Single ETF signal:
```bash
curl -s https://moltstreet.com/api/v1/etf/SPY
```

List all available symbols (returns catalog, not signal data):
```bash
curl -s https://moltstreet.com/api/v1/etf/
```
This returns `{"symbols": ["ASHR","DBA","DIA",...], "count": 52, ...}`. To get actual signals, fetch each symbol individually.

Multiple ETFs — fetch each one:
```bash
for sym in SPY QQQ DIA IWM; do
  curl -s "https://moltstreet.com/api/v1/etf/$sym"
done
```

## How to interpret and present

1. **Fetch** the signal for the requested ETF(s)
2. **Interpret** direction: `1` = bullish, `-1` = bearish, `0` = neutral
3. **Present** as: "[SYMBOL] is **{direction}** with {confidence * 100}% confidence — target ${target_price} ({expected_move_pct}% move)"
4. **Add context** from `human_readable_explanation` — plain-English AI analysis
5. **Show conviction** from `committee.votes` — 4 independent AI analysts voted
6. **Warn** with `risk_controls` — what could invalidate the signal

## Example agent interaction

User: "What's the outlook for tech stocks?"
→ Fetch XLK, QQQ, SOXX, SMH signals (4 calls)
→ Synthesize: "Tech sector is mixed — QQQ bearish (-1.2%, 85% conf) while SMH is bullish (+2.1%, 78% conf). The divergence is driven by..."
→ Add risk factors and committee consensus

User: "Any strong signals today?"
→ Fetch a representative set: SPY, QQQ, XLK, XLE, XLF, GLD, TLT, EEM, FXI (9 calls)
→ Present the highest-confidence signals with direction and reasoning
