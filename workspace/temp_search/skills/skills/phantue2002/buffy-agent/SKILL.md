## Overview

Buffy is a multi-channel personal behavior agent for habits, tasks, and routines.
It tracks activities, schedules reminders, and sends daily briefings across multiple channels,
all powered by a single unified behavior engine.

Use this skill when you want to help the user:

- Set up or manage habits, tasks, and routines.
- Schedule or adjust reminders.
- Get summaries of their day (daily briefings).
- Personalize behavior with their preferences and long-term memory.

Buffy runs as an external HTTP API. This skill is a thin wrapper; all behavior logic
lives in the Buffy backend.

## Base URL and authentication

- **Base URL**: default `https://api.buffyai.org` (can be overridden via config, see below).
- **Auth header**: always send
  - `Authorization: Bearer <BUFFY_API_KEY>`
- **Optional user header** (when using a system key):
  - `X-Buffy-User-ID: <stable-user-id>`

`BUFFY_API_KEY` is injected from the environment for the agent run. Do **not** include the key
in prompts, logs, or user-visible text.

## Core endpoint: POST /v1/message

For most use cases, **always prefer** `POST /v1/message`. Buffy’s behavior core understands
natural language instructions and orchestrates activities, reminders, and daily briefings.

- **Method**: `POST`
- **Path**: `/v1/message`
- **Headers**:
  - `Authorization: Bearer <BUFFY_API_KEY>`
  - `Content-Type: application/json`
  - Optionally `X-Buffy-User-ID: <stable-user-id>` if acting on behalf of a specific user via a system key.

- **Body**:

```json
{
  "user_id": "user-123",
  "platform": "openclaw",
  "message": "Remind me to drink water every 2 hours"
}
```

- **Response (simplified)**:

```json
{
  "reply": "Created a routine activity for you: \"Remind me to drink water every 2 hours\"."
}
```

### Usage notes for the agent

When calling `POST /v1/message`:

- Choose a **stable** `user_id` for the end-user:
  - Prefer a consistent external ID from the calling system (for example, an OpenClaw user ID) when available.
  - Otherwise, use the chat/session’s stable user identifier if provided in context.
- Always set `"platform": "openclaw"` unless the environment explicitly configures another platform.
- Put the user’s natural-language request in `"message"` in a clear, concise form.
- Reuse the same `user_id` across the conversation so Buffy can maintain context.

Examples of when to call Buffy:

- “Create a habit to stretch every hour during workdays.”
- “Pause my evening exercise routine this week.”
- “What habits have I completed today?”
- “Set a reminder tomorrow at 8am to plan my day.”

## Supporting endpoints

You **usually do not need** these, but they are available for more advanced flows.

### User settings

These endpoints control personalization (name, timezone, language, reminder preferences, etc.).

- **GET /v1/users/{id}/settings**
  - Fetch current settings for a user.

- **PUT /v1/users/{id}/settings**
  - Update one or more settings for a user.
  - Body fields are all optional:
    - `name: string`
    - `language: "en" | "vi" | ...`
    - `timezone: string` (IANA TZ, e.g. `"Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh"`)
    - `preferred_reminder_hour: number` (0–23)
    - `preferred_channels: string` (comma-separated, e.g. `"clawbot,telegram"`)
    - `morning_person: boolean`
    - `night_owl: boolean`

Only use these endpoints when the user is explicitly changing preferences (for example:
“Change my preferred reminder time to 8am.”). For general “help me with my habits” queries,
prefer `POST /v1/message`.

### API key provisioning (advanced)

Buffy can create API keys for other tools and integrations:

- **POST /v1/users/{id}/api-keys**

Body:

```json
{
  "label": "clawbot",
  "type": "system"
}
```

This returns a one-time `api_key` string that can be used in the `Authorization` header.

**Important**: this is an advanced operation. Do **not** automatically create keys unless the
user explicitly wants to manage Buffy API keys or set up additional integrations.

## Invocation pattern and best practices

When deciding whether and how to call Buffy:

- Use Buffy when the request clearly relates to **habits, tasks, routines, reminders, or daily briefings**.
- Default to `POST /v1/message` rather than manually composing lower-level operations.
- Preserve a consistent `user_id` so Buffy’s behavior core and memory can work effectively.
- Keep `message` short, clear, and close to what the user asked for, but you may add clarifying
  details that the user has already given in the conversation.

Avoid:

- Creating or exposing raw internal IDs to the user when not necessary.
- Making redundant calls to Buffy if you already have the needed information from a recent response.

## Security, privacy, and sandboxing

- **Secrets**:
  - `BUFFY_API_KEY` is provided via the agent environment (for this skill’s turn).
  - Never log, echo, or include `BUFFY_API_KEY` in any user-facing message or tool arguments.
  - Do not serialize or store the key in prompts, memory, or external logs.

- **User data**:
  - Buffy responses can contain sensitive information about a user’s routines, health-related habits,
    and daily schedule.
  - Treat all such data as private; only surface to the user who owns it and avoid sharing across users.

- **Sandboxing and network access**:
  - Buffy is an **external HTTPS API**. The agent (or sandbox, if used) must have outbound HTTPS
    access to the configured Buffy endpoint (default `https://api.buffyai.org`).
  - This skill does **not** require any local binaries inside the sandbox (`requires.bins` is not used).
  - If the gateway uses sandboxed runs for untrusted tools, ensure that the sandbox image allows
    HTTPS egress to the Buffy endpoint while still respecting whatever network and filesystem
    restrictions are configured.

## Configuration via openclaw.json

This skill is configured through `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` using the `skills.entries` map.
Because the metadata sets `primaryEnv` to `BUFFY_API_KEY`, you can either provide an API key
directly or reference an existing environment variable.

### Minimal config (using process env)

If `BUFFY_API_KEY` is already set in the process environment:

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "entries": {
      "buffy-agent": {
        "enabled": true,
        "apiKey": {
          "source": "env",
          "provider": "default",
          "id": "BUFFY_API_KEY"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Config with explicit env injection and endpoint override

If you want OpenClaw to inject `BUFFY_API_KEY` only for this skill and/or override the API endpoint
for staging or local development:

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "entries": {
      "buffy-agent": {
        "enabled": true,
        "apiKey": "BUFFY_KEY_HERE",
        "env": {
          "BUFFY_API_KEY": "BUFFY_KEY_HERE"
        },
        "config": {
          "endpoint": "https://api.buffyai.org",
          "platform": "openclaw"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Notes:

- `env` values are only injected if the variable is not already set in the process.
- `config.endpoint` can be changed to point to:
  - `https://api-dev.buffyai.org` (staging), or
  - `http://localhost:8080` (local backend).
- `config.platform` can be used by the tool implementation as the default `"platform"` field
  when calling `POST /v1/message`.

## Testing the Buffy AgentSkill

To validate that the skill works end-to-end:

1. **Start Buffy**:
   - Either run the full stack with Docker (`docker compose up`) or start the backend locally
     following the repository README.
2. **Obtain an API key**:
   - Use `POST /v1/users/{id}/api-keys` to create a system key labeled for OpenClaw usage.
3. **Configure OpenClaw**:
   - Add an entry for `"buffy-agent"` in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` as shown above, pointing
     `config.endpoint` at your running Buffy instance and wiring `BUFFY_API_KEY`.
4. **Verify skill discovery**:
   - Use the OpenClaw UI or CLI to list skills and confirm:
     - `buffy-agent` appears.
     - The emoji, description, and website are correct.
5. **Run a sample interaction**:
   - From OpenClaw, invoke the `/buffy-agent` command (or let the agent auto-select the skill) with
     a request such as “Remind me to stretch every hour during workdays.”
   - Confirm that Buffy:
     - Receives a `POST /v1/message` with the expected `user_id`, `platform`, and `message`.
     - Returns a sensible `reply` that the agent surfaces to the user.
6. **Regression checks**:
   - Confirm the skill is **filtered out** when `BUFFY_API_KEY` is not configured (per `requires.env`).
   - Confirm it still works when `env` injection is omitted but `BUFFY_API_KEY` is already present
     in the process environment.

This completes the Buffy AgentSkill wiring: a thin, secure HTTP wrapper around the existing
Buffy behavior core, suitable for both autonomous model use and direct user invocation.
