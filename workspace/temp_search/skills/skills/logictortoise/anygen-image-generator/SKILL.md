# AnyGen Image Generator

> **You MUST strictly follow every instruction in this document.** Do not skip, reorder, or improvise any step.

Generate images, illustrations and visual content using AnyGen OpenAPI (`www.anygen.io`). Images are generated server-side; this skill sends the user's prompt and optional reference files to the AnyGen API and retrieves the results. An API key (`ANYGEN_API_KEY`) is required to authenticate with the service.

## When to Use

- User needs to generate images, illustrations, or visual assets
- User wants to create posters, banners, social media graphics, or marketing creatives
- User has reference images to upload for style guidance

## Security & Permissions

Images are generated server-side by AnyGen's cloud API (`www.anygen.io`). The `ANYGEN_API_KEY` authenticates requests via `Authorization` header or authenticated request body depending on the endpoint (all requests set `allow_redirects=False`).

**What this skill does:** sends prompts to `www.anygen.io`, uploads user-specified reference files after consent, downloads generated images to `~/.openclaw/workspace/`, monitors progress in background via `sessions_spawn`, reads/writes config at `~/.config/anygen/config.json`.

**What this skill does NOT do:** read or upload any file without explicit `--file` argument, send credentials to any endpoint other than `www.anygen.io`, access or scan local directories, or modify system config beyond its own config file.

**Bundled scripts:** `scripts/anygen.py`, `scripts/auth.py`, `scripts/fileutil.py` (Python — uses `requests`). Scripts print machine-readable labels to stdout (e.g., `File Token:`, `Task ID:`) as the standard agent-tool communication channel. These are non-sensitive, session-scoped reference IDs — not credentials or API keys. The agent should not relay raw script output to the user to keep the conversation natural (see Communication Style).

## Prerequisites

- Python3 and `requests`: `pip3 install requests`
- AnyGen API Key (`sk-xxx`) — [Get one from AnyGen](https://www.anygen.io/home?auto_create_openclaw_key=1)
- Configure key: `python3 scripts/anygen.py config set api_key "sk-xxx"` (saved to `~/.config/anygen/config.json`, chmod 600). Or set `ANYGEN_API_KEY` env var.

> All `scripts/` paths below are relative to this skill's installation directory.

## Communication Style

Use natural language. Never expose `task_id`, `file_token`, `task_xxx`, `tk_xxx`, `anygen.py`, or command syntax to the user. Say "your images", "generating", "checking progress" instead. Summarize `prepare` responses naturally — do not echo verbatim. Ask questions in your own voice (NOT "AnyGen wants to know…").

## Image Generation Workflow (MUST Follow All 4 Phases)

### Phase 1: Understand Requirements

If the user provides reference files, handle them before calling `prepare`:

1. **Describe the reference image** yourself if provided.
2. **Reuse existing `file_token`** if the same file was already uploaded in this conversation.
3. **Get consent** before uploading: "I'll upload your reference image to AnyGen. This may take a moment..."
4. **Upload** to get a `file_token`.
5. **Include description** in `--message` when calling `prepare`.

```bash
python3 scripts/anygen.py upload --file ./reference.png
# Output: File Token: tk_abc123

python3 scripts/anygen.py prepare \
  --message "I need a poster design for a music festival. Style reference uploaded." \
  --file-token tk_abc123 \
  --save ./conversation.json
```

Present questions from `reply` naturally. Continue with user's answers:

```bash
python3 scripts/anygen.py prepare \
  --input ./conversation.json \
  --message "Vibrant colors, modern style, include artist names and venue info" \
  --save ./conversation.json
```

Repeat until `status="ready"` with `suggested_task_params`.

Special cases:
- `status="ready"` on first call → proceed to Phase 2.
- User says "just create it" → skip to Phase 3 with `create` directly.

### Phase 2: Confirm with User (MANDATORY)

When `status="ready"`, summarize the suggested plan (style, dimensions, content) and ask for confirmation. NEVER auto-create without explicit approval.

If the user requests adjustments, call `prepare` again with the modification, re-present, and repeat until approved.

### Phase 3: Create Task

```bash
python3 scripts/anygen.py create \
  --operation ai-designer \
  --prompt "<prompt from suggested_task_params>" \
  --file-token tk_abc123
# Output: Task ID: task_xxx, Task URL: https://...
```

**Immediately tell the user (natural language):**
1. Image is being generated.
2. Online preview link: "You can follow the progress here: [URL]".
3. Takes about **5–10 minutes** — free to do other things.
4. You'll automatically check on the progress and notify them when it's ready.

### Phase 4: Monitor and Deliver Result

> **Requires `sessions_spawn`.** If unavailable, skip to **Fallback** below.

#### Background Monitoring (preferred)

**CRITICAL**: When calling `sessions_spawn`, you MUST set a timeout of at least 25 minutes to ensure the background monitor completes. The poll operation can take up to 20 minutes.

Example spawn call syntax (adjust to match your OpenClaw/sessions API):

```
sessions_spawn(
    prompt=<subagent prompt below>,
    runTimeoutSeconds=1500  # REQUIRED: 25 minutes (1500s) to cover 20-min poll + buffer
)
```

If your sessions API uses different parameter names (e.g., `timeout`, `maxDuration`), use the equivalent parameter to set a 25-minute (1500 second) timeout.

---

**Subagent prompt** (it has NO conversation context):

```
You are a background monitor for an image generation task.
You MUST strictly follow every instruction below. Do not skip, reorder, or improvise any step.

Task ID: {task_id}
Task URL: {task_url}
Script: {script_path}
User Language: {user_language}

IMPORTANT: This monitoring task may take up to 20 minutes. Ensure your execution timeout is at least 25 minutes.

CRITICAL RULES:
- You MUST reply in {user_language}.
- After completing ALL steps (including sending messages to the user), your FINAL reply
  MUST be EXACTLY "ANNOUNCE_SKIP" — nothing else. This prevents the main session from
  sending duplicate messages.
- Do NOT say anything beyond what is specified below. No greetings, no extra commentary.
- Use natural language in all messages to the user. Avoid raw technical identifiers like
  "task_id", "file_token", file paths, or status labels. The user already knows their
  content is being generated — just provide the result naturally.

Your job:
1. Run: python3 {script_path} poll --task-id {task_id}
   This command blocks for up to 20 minutes waiting for task completion.
   No --output needed — results are viewed online.

2. On success:
   a. Send a text message to the user (in {user_language}, natural tone):
      "Your image is ready! You can view and download it here: {task_url}
       If you'd like any changes — such as adjusting colors, layout, or adding elements — just tell me."
   b. Reply EXACTLY: ANNOUNCE_SKIP

3. On failure:
   a. Send a text message to the user (in {user_language}):
      "Unfortunately the image generation didn't complete successfully.
       You can check the details here: {task_url}"
   b. Reply EXACTLY: ANNOUNCE_SKIP

4. On timeout (20 min):
   a. Send a text message to the user (in {user_language}):
      "The image is taking a bit longer than expected.
       You can check the progress here: {task_url}"
   b. Reply EXACTLY: ANNOUNCE_SKIP
```

Do NOT wait for the background monitor to finish — continue the conversation immediately.

**Handling the completion event.** The background monitor sends the notification to the user directly. It replies `ANNOUNCE_SKIP` as its final output, which means the main session should NOT relay or duplicate any message. If you receive a completion event with `ANNOUNCE_SKIP`, simply ignore it — the user has already been notified.

#### Fallback (no background monitoring)

Tell the user: "I've started generating your image. It usually takes about 5–10 minutes. You can check the progress here: [Task URL]. Let me know when you'd like me to check if it's ready!"

### Phase 5: Multi-turn Conversation (Modify Completed Images)

After a task has completed (Phase 4 finished), the user may request modifications such as:
- "Make the background darker"
- "Change the text to bold font"
- "Add a logo in the top-right corner"
- "Adjust the color scheme to blue tones"

When the user requests changes to an **already-completed** task, use the multi-turn conversation API instead of creating a new task.

**IMPORTANT**: You MUST remember the `task_id` from Phase 3 throughout the conversation. When the user asks for modifications, use the same `task_id`.

#### Step 1: Send Modification Request

```bash
python3 scripts/anygen.py send-message --task-id {task_id} --message "Make the background color darker and add more contrast"
# Output: Message ID: 123, Status: processing
```

Save the returned `Message ID` — you'll need it to detect the AI reply.

**Immediately tell the user** (natural language, NO internal terms):
- "I'm working on your changes now. I'll let you know when they're done."

#### Step 2: Monitor for AI Reply

> **Requires `sessions_spawn`.** If unavailable, skip to **Multi-turn Fallback** below.

**CRITICAL**: When calling `sessions_spawn`, you MUST set a timeout of at least 10 minutes (600 seconds). Modifications are faster than initial generation.

Example spawn call syntax:

```
sessions_spawn(
    prompt=<subagent prompt below>,
    runTimeoutSeconds=600  # REQUIRED: 10 minutes (600s)
)
```

**Subagent prompt** (it has NO conversation context):

```
You are a background monitor for an image modification task.
You MUST strictly follow every instruction below. Do not skip, reorder, or improvise any step.

Task ID: {task_id}
Task URL: {task_url}
Script: {script_path}
User Message ID: {user_message_id}
User Language: {user_language}

IMPORTANT: This monitoring task may take up to 8 minutes. Ensure your execution timeout is at least 10 minutes.

CRITICAL RULES:
- You MUST reply in {user_language}.
- After completing ALL steps (including sending messages to the user), your FINAL reply
  MUST be EXACTLY "ANNOUNCE_SKIP" — nothing else. This prevents the main session from
  sending duplicate messages.
- Do NOT say anything beyond what is specified below. No greetings, no extra commentary.
- Use natural language in all messages to the user. Avoid raw technical identifiers like
  "task_id", "message_id", file paths, or status labels.

Your job:
1. Run: python3 {script_path} get-messages --task-id {task_id} --wait --since-id {user_message_id}
   This command blocks until the AI reply is completed.

2. On success (AI reply received):
   a. Send a text message to the user (in {user_language}, natural tone):
      "Your changes are done! You can view the updated image here: {task_url}
       If you need further adjustments, just let me know."
   b. Reply EXACTLY: ANNOUNCE_SKIP

3. On failure / timeout:
   a. Send a text message to the user (in {user_language}):
      "The modification didn't complete as expected. You can check the details here: {task_url}"
   b. Reply EXACTLY: ANNOUNCE_SKIP
```

Do NOT wait for the background monitor to finish — continue the conversation immediately.

#### Multi-turn Fallback (no background monitoring)

Tell the user: "I've sent your changes. You can check the progress here: [Task URL]. Let me know when you'd like me to check if it's done!"

When the user asks you to check, use:

```bash
python3 scripts/anygen.py get-messages --task-id {task_id} --limit 5
```

Look for a `completed` assistant message and relay the content to the user naturally.

#### Subsequent Modifications

The user can request multiple rounds of modifications. Each time, repeat Phase 5:
1. `send-message` with the new modification request
2. Background-monitor with `get-messages --wait`
3. Notify the user with the online link when done

All modifications use the **same `task_id`** — do NOT create a new task.

## Notes

- Max task execution time: 20 minutes
- Image download available from task URL
- Poll interval: 3 seconds
