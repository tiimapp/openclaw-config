## Consumable Tracking

Keep tabs on parts that need replacement.

```bash
$ bash scripts/roomba-ctl.sh consumables

Consumable Status — Rosie (j7+)
────────────────────────────────────
Main Brush:     ████████░░ 78%   (~44 hours remaining)
Side Brush:     █████░░░░░ 52%   (~26 hours remaining)
Filter:         ███░░░░░░░ 31%   (~15 hours remaining)  ⚠️ Replace soon
Bin:            Full — Empty before next clean
Dust Bag:       ███████░░░ 68%   (auto-empty base)

Estimated based on 6.2 hrs/week average usage.
```

```bash
# Alert if any consumable below threshold
bash scripts/roomba-ctl.sh consumables --alert 20
# Exit code 1 if any below 20%

# Reset consumable counter after replacement
bash scripts/roomba-ctl.sh consumables reset filter
bash scripts/roomba-ctl.sh consumables reset main_brush
```

## Cleaning History & Maps

```bash
# Recent cleaning sessions
bash scripts/roomba-ctl.sh history
bash scripts/roomba-ctl.sh history --limit 20

# Detailed session report
bash scripts/roomba-ctl.sh history <session_id>

# Cleaning statistics
bash scripts/roomba-ctl.sh stats
# Output: This week: 4 cleans, 3.2 hrs, 1,240 sq ft avg
#         This month: 14 cleans, 11.8 hrs, 1,180 sq ft avg

# Coverage map (ASCII visualization)
bash scripts/roomba-ctl.sh map
```

---

## Multi-Robot Support

```bash
# List all robots
bash scripts/roomba-ctl.sh robots

# Switch default robot
bash scripts/roomba-ctl.sh use "Dusty"

# Command a specific robot
bash scripts/roomba-ctl.sh --robot "Dusty" clean

# Start all robots
bash scripts/roomba-ctl.sh clean --all

# Status of all robots
bash scripts/roomba-ctl.sh status --all
```

---

## Scripting & Automation

**Clean before guests arrive (cron):**
```bash
# Friday at 4 PM — clean living areas
0 16 * * 5 bash /path/to/roomba-ctl.sh clean --rooms "Living Room,Dining Room,Kitchen"
```

**Post-clean notification:**
```bash
bash scripts/roomba-ctl.sh clean
while bash scripts/roomba-ctl.sh status --raw | grep -q "running"; do sleep 60; done
echo "Cleaning complete!" | mail -s "Roomba Done" you@email.com
```

**Consumable shopping reminder:**
```bash
LOW=$(bash scripts/roomba-ctl.sh consumables --alert 25 --names)
if [ -n "$LOW" ]; then
  echo "Time to order: $LOW" | mail -s "Roomba Parts Needed" you@email.com
fi
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Robot offline" | Check Wi-Fi. Reboot robot (hold CLEAN 10s). Verify iRobot app works. |
| "Authentication failed" | Re-run `setup`. Check credentials. Verify 2FA if enabled. |
| "Room not found" | Room names must match exactly. Use `bash scripts/roomba-ctl.sh rooms` to list. |
| "Cannot clean — bin full" | Empty the dustbin or dust bag, then retry. |
| Slow response | iRobot cloud can be slow. Script retries 3x with backoff. |
