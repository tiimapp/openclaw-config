```

## Step 1: Prepare Your Data

Your CSV must have these columns (order doesn't matter):

| Column | Required | Format | Example |
|--------|----------|--------|---------|
| date | ✅ | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS | 2024-03-15 14:30:00 |
| type | ✅ | buy/sell/swap/transfer | buy |
| asset | ✅ | Symbol | BTC |
| amount | ✅ | Decimal number | 0.5 |
| price_usd | ✅ | USD value per unit | 65000.00 |
| fee_usd | ❌ | Fee in USD | 2.50 |
| exchange | ❌ | Exchange name | Binance |
| tx_hash | ❌ | Transaction hash | 0xabc... |

## Step 2: Choose Your Method

```bash
# FIFO — First In, First Out (most common, required in some jurisdictions)
bash scripts/crypto-tax-calc.sh calculate --input trades.csv --method fifo --country US

# LIFO — Last In, First Out (can minimize taxes in rising markets)
bash scripts/crypto-tax-calc.sh calculate --input trades.csv --method lifo --country US

# Average Cost — Weighted average (required in UK, simpler calculation)
bash scripts/crypto-tax-calc.sh calculate --input trades.csv --method average --country UK
```

## Step 3: Select Jurisdiction

### 🇺🇸 United States
- Short-term gains (<1 year): Taxed as ordinary income (10%-37%)
- Long-term gains (>1 year): 0%, 15%, or 20%
- Wash sale rules: Currently not enforced for crypto (may change)
- Form 8949 generation supported

### 🇬🇧 United Kingdom
- Capital Gains Tax: 10% (basic) / 20% (higher rate)
- Annual exempt amount: £6,000 (2024/25)
- Must use share pooling (average cost)
- HMRC-compatible report format

### 🇦🇺 Australia
- CGT discount: 50% for assets held >12 months
- Marginal tax rates apply (19%-45%)
- Personal use asset exemption <$10,000
- ATO-compatible output

### 🇨🇳 China
- Individual income tax: 20% on gains
- Currently ambiguous regulation
- Report provides gain calculations for reference

## Step 4: Generate Report

The tool outputs:
- **HTML Report** — Visual summary with charts, tables, per-asset breakdown
- **CSV Export** — Machine-readable gain/loss per trade
- **Summary JSON** — Totals for integration with other tools
