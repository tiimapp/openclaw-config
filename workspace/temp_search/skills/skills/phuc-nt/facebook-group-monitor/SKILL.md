# Facebook Group Monitor Skill

## Overview

Playwright-based headless browser scraper for Facebook groups. Default behavior:
**captures screenshots** of each post with images → agent uses vision model to extract information.

Requires one-time manual login via terminal to establish a persistent browser session.

## Setup

See [references/SETUP.md](references/SETUP.md) for installation and first-time login instructions.

## File Locations (after install)

- **Script**: `scripts/fb-group-monitor.py`
- **Shell wrapper**: `scripts/fb-group-monitor.sh`
- **Browser session**: auto-created at `scripts/.browser-data/` (persistent login)
- **Seen posts**: auto-created at `scripts/.seen-posts.json` (dedup tracking)
- **Screenshots**: `scripts/screenshots/` or custom `--shots-dir`

## Commands

### 1. Check login session
```bash
scripts/fb-group-monitor.sh status
```
Output:
```json
{"success": true, "action": "status", "message": "Session active — đã đăng nhập Facebook."}
```

### 2. Scrape new posts (with screenshots)
```bash
scripts/fb-group-monitor.sh scrape <GROUP_URL> [--limit N] [--shots-dir <PATH>]
```

**Parameters:**
- `GROUP_URL`: Full URL (https://www.facebook.com/groups/123456) or just group ID
- `--limit N`: Max posts to scrape (default: 10)
- `--shots-dir <PATH>`: ⚠️ **RECOMMENDED** — save screenshots in agent workspace so image tool can read them
- `--no-shots`: Skip screenshots (faster, text-only)

**Example:**
```bash
scripts/fb-group-monitor.sh scrape "https://www.facebook.com/groups/123456789" --limit 10 --shots-dir ./temp-screenshots
```

**Output JSON (with screenshots):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "action": "scrape",
  "group_name": "Example Group Name",
  "group_url": "https://www.facebook.com/groups/123456789",
  "total_scraped": 6,
  "new_count": 3,
  "screenshots_taken": 2,
  "posts": [
    {
      "author": "Poster Name",
      "text": "Post content (may be truncated)...",
      "url": "https://facebook.com/groups/123456/posts/789",
      "images": 3,
      "screenshot_path": "/path/to/temp-screenshots/abc123.jpg"
    },
    {
      "author": "Another Poster",
      "text": "Text-only post, no images...",
      "url": "https://facebook.com/groups/123456/posts/790",
      "images": 0
    }
  ],
  "message": "Tìm thấy 3 bài mới / 6 bài tổng cộng. Đã chụp 2 ảnh."
}
```

> **Note**: `screenshot_path` only present for posts with images (`images > 0`).
> Posts without images have text content only — read directly from `text` field.

### 3. Clean old screenshots
```bash
scripts/fb-group-monitor.sh clean-shots
```
Auto-removes screenshots older than 48h and caps at 100 max. Script also auto-cleans before each scrape.

### 4. Login (one-time, from terminal)
```bash
scripts/fb-group-monitor.sh login
```
Opens browser, login manually, press Enter to save session. Session lasts weeks/months.

## Agent Workflow

When triggered by cron or user request to check a group:

### Step 1: Scrape
```bash
scripts/fb-group-monitor.sh scrape "<GROUP_URL>" --limit 10 --shots-dir ./temp-screenshots
```
> ⚠️ **Use `--shots-dir`** pointing to a path within the workspace so the image tool can access screenshots.

### Step 2: Process each new post

**Posts WITH `screenshot_path`** (has attached images):
- Read the screenshot file using vision
- Use LLM vision to extract relevant information from the image
- Combine with `text` field for complete context
- Prioritize image content (usually more complete than truncated text)

**Posts WITHOUT `screenshot_path`** (text-only):
- Read directly from `text` field
- Summarize available information

### Step 3: Report to user

**MUST** include the original post link in each item for verification.

```
Format per new post:

📌 *[Title/Summary]*
👤 Author: [author]
📝 [Key details extracted]
🔗 [post URL]
```

### Step 4: If no new posts → stay silent (no notification)
### Step 5: If `success == false` → report error briefly

## Important Notes

- **Rate limiting**: Recommended cron interval ≥ 2 hours — safe for Facebook
- **Session expired**: If error "Chưa đăng nhập" → run `login` from terminal
- **UI changes**: Facebook updates DOM frequently → selectors may need updates
- **"See more"**: Text is truncated — screenshots usually have more complete content
- **Screenshot quality**: JPEG 82% — sufficient for LLM vision to read text and recognize images
