        # Checkout Friction Audit

        ## Skill Card

        - **Category:** Conversion
        - **Core problem:** Which checkout steps are leaking intent and killing purchase completion?
        - **Best for:** Conversion rate recovery projects
        - **Expected input:** Checkout flow notes, abandonment signals, user complaints, policy constraints
        - **Expected output:** Friction map with severity, likely cause, and fix priority
        - **Creatop handoff:** Push fixes into sprint board and rerun after implementation

        ## Workflow

        1. Map checkout path and identify complaint-linked touchpoints.
2. Score friction by impact on completion and fix complexity.
3. Separate UX friction from trust/compliance friction.
4. Output top quick wins and structural fixes.

        ## Output format

        Return in this order:
        1. Executive summary (max 5 lines)
        2. Priority actions (P0/P1/P2)
        3. Evidence table (signal, confidence, risk)
        4. 7-day execution plan

        ## Quality and safety rules

        - Tie each recommendation to observed evidence, not guesswork.
- Prioritize reversible low-risk fixes first.
- Avoid recommendations that violate platform/payment policies.
