# here.now

**Skill version: 1.8.0**

Create a live URL from any file or folder. Static hosting only.

To install or update (recommended): `npx skills add heredotnow/skill --skill here-now -g`

For repo-pinned/project-local installs, run the same command without `-g`.

If npm is unavailable, see fallback install docs: https://here.now/docs#install-skill

## Requirements

- Required binaries: `curl`, `file`, `jq`
- Optional environment variable: `$HERENOW_API_KEY`
- Optional credentials file: `~/.herenow/credentials`

## Create a site

```bash
./scripts/publish.sh {file-or-dir}
```

Outputs the live URL (e.g. `https://bright-canvas-a7k2.here.now/`).

Under the hood this is a three-step flow: create/update -> upload files -> finalize. A site is not live until finalize succeeds.

Without an API key this creates an **anonymous site** that expires in 24 hours.
With a saved API key, the site is permanent.

**File structure:** For HTML sites, place `index.html` at the root of the directory you publish, not inside a subdirectory. The directory's contents become the site root. For example, publish `my-site/` where `my-site/index.html` exists — don't publish a parent folder that contains `my-site/`.

You can also publish raw files without any HTML. Single files get a rich auto-viewer (images, PDF, video, audio). Multiple files get an auto-generated directory listing with folder navigation and an image gallery.

## Update an existing site

```bash
./scripts/publish.sh {file-or-dir} --slug {slug}
```

The script auto-loads the `claimToken` from `.herenow/state.json` when updating anonymous sites. Pass `--claim-token {token}` to override.

Authenticated updates require a saved API key.

## Client attribution

Pass `--client` so here.now can track reliability by agent:

```bash
./scripts/publish.sh {file-or-dir} --client cursor
```

This sends `X-HereNow-Client: cursor/publish-sh` on publish API calls.
If omitted, the script sends a fallback value.

## API key storage

The publish script reads the API key from these sources (first match wins):

1. `--api-key {key}` flag (CI/scripting only — avoid in interactive use)
2. `$HERENOW_API_KEY` environment variable
3. `~/.herenow/credentials` file (recommended for agents)

To store a key, write it to the credentials file:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.herenow && echo "{API_KEY}" > ~/.herenow/credentials && chmod 600 ~/.herenow/credentials
```

**IMPORTANT**: After receiving an API key, save it immediately — run the command above yourself. Do not ask the user to run it manually. Avoid passing the key via CLI flags (e.g. `--api-key`) in interactive sessions; the credentials file is the preferred storage method.

Never commit credentials or local state files (`~/.herenow/credentials`, `.herenow/state.json`) to source control.

## State file

After every site create/update, the script writes to `.herenow/state.json` in the working directory:

```json
{
  "publishes": {
    "bright-canvas-a7k2": {
      "siteUrl": "https://bright-canvas-a7k2.here.now/",
      "claimToken": "abc123",
      "claimUrl": "https://here.now/claim?slug=bright-canvas-a7k2&token=abc123",
      "expiresAt": "2026-02-18T01:00:00.000Z"
    }
  }
}
```

Before creating or updating sites, you may check this file to find prior slugs.
Treat `.herenow/state.json` as internal cache only.
Never present this local file path as a URL, and never use it as source of truth for auth mode, expiry, or claim URL.

## What to tell the user

- Always share the `siteUrl` from the current script run.
- Read and follow `publish_result.*` lines from script stderr to determine auth mode.
- When `publish_result.auth_mode=authenticated`: tell the user the site is **permanent** and saved to their account. No claim URL is needed.
- When `publish_result.auth_mode=anonymous`: tell the user the site **expires in 24 hours**. Share the claim URL (if `publish_result.claim_url` is non-empty and starts with `https://`) so they can keep it permanently. Warn that claim tokens are only returned once and cannot be recovered.
- Never tell the user to inspect `.herenow/state.json` for claim URLs or auth status.

## Limits

|                | Anonymous          | Authenticated                |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Max file size  | 250 MB             | 5 GB                         |

| Account needed | No                 | Yes (get key at here.now)    |

## Getting an API key

To upgrade from anonymous (24h) to permanent sites:

1. Ask the user for their email address.
2. Request a one-time sign-in code:

```bash
curl -sS https://here.now/api/auth/agent/request-code \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "user@example.com"}'
```

3. Tell the user: "Check your inbox for a sign-in code from here.now and paste it here."
4. Verify the code and get the API key:

```bash
curl -sS https://here.now/api/auth/agent/verify-code \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com","code":"ABCD-2345"}'
```

5. Save the returned `apiKey` yourself (do not ask the user to do this):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.herenow && echo "{API_KEY}" > ~/.herenow/credentials && chmod 600 ~/.herenow/credentials
```

## Script options

| Flag                   | Description                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `--slug {slug}`        | Update an existing site instead of creating |
| `--claim-token {token}`| Override claim token for anonymous updates    |
| `--title {text}`       | Viewer title (non-HTML sites)             |
| `--description {text}` | Viewer description                            |
| `--ttl {seconds}`      | Set expiry (authenticated only)               |
| `--client {name}`      | Agent name for attribution (e.g. `cursor`)    |
| `--base-url {url}`     | API base URL (default: `https://here.now`)    |
| `--allow-nonherenow-base-url` | Allow sending auth to non-default `--base-url` |
| `--api-key {key}`      | API key override (prefer credentials file)    |

## Duplicate a site

```bash
curl -sS -X POST https://here.now/api/v1/publish/{slug}/duplicate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'
```

Creates a full copy of the site under a new slug. All files are copied server-side — no upload needed. The new site is immediately live. Requires authentication and ownership of the source site.

Optionally override viewer metadata (shallow-merged with the source):

```bash
curl -sS -X POST https://here.now/api/v1/publish/{slug}/duplicate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"viewer": {"title": "My Copy"}}'
```

## Beyond the script

For delete, metadata patch (including password protection), duplicate, claim, list, and other operations, see [references/REFERENCE.md](references/REFERENCE.md).

## Handle and links quick reference

- Handles are user-owned subdomain namespaces on `here.now` (for example, `yourname.here.now`) that route paths to your sites.
- Any account with an API key can claim a handle.
- Handle endpoints: `/api/v1/handle`
- Link endpoints: `/api/v1/links` and `/api/v1/links/:location`
- Root location sentinel for path params remains `__root__`
- Handle/link changes can take up to 60 seconds to propagate globally (Cloudflare KV)

## Custom domains

Bring your own domain (e.g. `example.com`) and serve sites from it. Requires a paid plan (Hobby or above).

### Add a custom domain

```bash
curl -sS https://here.now/api/v1/domains \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"domain": "example.com"}'
```

Response includes DNS instructions. Point an ALIAS record (or CNAME for subdomains) to `fallback.here.now`. SSL is provisioned automatically.

### Check domain status

```bash
curl -sS https://here.now/api/v1/domains/example.com \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}"
```

Status is `pending` until DNS is verified and SSL is active, then becomes `active`.

### Link a site to a custom domain

Use the `domain` parameter when creating a link:

```bash
curl -sS https://here.now/api/v1/links \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"location": "", "slug": "bright-canvas-a7k2", "domain": "example.com"}'
```

An empty `location` makes it the homepage (`https://example.com/`). Use `"location": "docs"` for `https://example.com/docs/`.

### List custom domains

```bash
curl -sS https://here.now/api/v1/domains \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}"
```

### Remove a custom domain

```bash
curl -sS -X DELETE https://here.now/api/v1/domains/example.com \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}"
```

Removes the domain and all links under it.

### Key points

- Custom domains: 1 on Free, up to 5 on Hobby
- Most domains use an ALIAS record (sometimes called ANAME or CNAME flattening)
- Subdomains (e.g. `docs.example.com`) can also use a standard CNAME record
- Domain endpoints: `/api/v1/domains` and `/api/v1/domains/:domain`
- Links to custom domains use the same `/api/v1/links` endpoint with an added `domain` parameter
- Changes propagate globally in up to 60 seconds (Cloudflare KV)
