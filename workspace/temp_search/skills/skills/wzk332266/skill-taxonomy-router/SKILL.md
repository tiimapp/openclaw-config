name: skill-router
description: Route user tasks to the most relevant skills using a layered taxonomy, risk model, and minimum-necessary-loading strategy. Use when deciding which skill to load, when multiple skills could apply, when new downloaded skills need classification, when evaluating whether a skill may threaten the system, or when maintaining a persistent task-to-skill routing policy.

# Skill Router

Use this skill to classify skills, choose which skill(s) to load for a task, and assess risk before loading action-capable skills.

## Core policy

Follow this priority order:
1. Best task fit
2. Lowest sufficient risk
3. Lowest context cost
4. Fewest skills needed
5. Expand only if blocked

Do not load skills mechanically. Load the single most specific relevant skill first. Add a second skill only when it clearly fills a missing capability.

## Domain taxonomy

Classify each skill into exactly one primary domain and one subdomain.
Optional: assign up to two secondary domains.

Primary domains:
- A. Communication & Collaboration
- B. Knowledge & Retrieval
- C. Development & Agentic Work
- D. System & Infrastructure
- E. Business Ops & Growth
- F. Personal Productivity
- G. Devices & IoT
- H. Mobility & Lifestyle
- I. Finance & Trading
- Z. Meta / Platform Extension / Unclassified

### Subdomain risk baselines
Use these subdomains and default risk baselines when classifying current or future skills.

- Z1 skill marketplace/install/update -> R2-R3
- Z2 credentials/vaults/secrets -> R4
- Z3 bridges/proxies/platform adapters -> R2-R4
- Z4 temporary unclassified -> default R2 until reviewed

## Risk model

Use these levels:
- R0 read-only safe lookup
- R1 low-risk local/personal writing
- R2 moderate automation or remote write
- R3 high-risk control, permissions, external sending, service/config changes, device control
- R4 critical risk: credentials, money movement, infra privilege, proxying, production-impact actions

## Threat dimensions
For each skill, assess these dimensions:
- local_system: writes config/files, installs, executes shell, restarts services
- data_egress: uploads or sends local/remote data outward
- external_action: sends messages/emails/posts or mutates remote systems
- physical_world: controls devices, temperature, machinery, robotics
- auth_permission: handles credentials, sharing, IAM, vaults, privilege boundaries
- financial_asset: trading, payments, budgets, billable/valuable asset movement

## Capability tags
Assign 1-5 tags when classifying a skill:
- read-only
- search
- retrieve
- write-local
- write-remote
- message-send
- browser-act
- device-control
- finance
- credential
- automation
- agent-orchestration
- knowledge-base
- calendar
- notes
- crm
- cloud-infra
- security
- content-publish
- monitoring
- setup-install

## Routing algorithm
When a task arrives, do this:

1. Infer task intent in one sentence.
2. Determine the main object:
   - message, document, knowledge, code, browser, system, cloud, device, travel, finance, etc.
3. Determine the main action:
   - search, read, analyze, create, edit, send, schedule, control, install, update, trade, automate.
4. Search for the most specific matching subdomain.
5. Prefer one skill with the highest specificity.
6. If that skill lacks a needed capability, add one complementary skill only.
7. Avoid loading broad meta-skills if a narrower skill exists.
8. If multiple candidate skills remain, prefer:
   - lower risk
   - more read-only
   - more direct fit
   - fewer side effects
   - lower context cost
9. If task is ambiguous, stay with the least risky useful skill or ask only one clarifying question.
10. If task needs no skill, use built-in tools directly.
11. After a skill is actually chosen and used, local implementations may optionally record the routing decision as part of their own private governance workflow.

## Multi-skill composition rules
Use multiple skills only when roles are distinct, for example:
- retrieval skill + writing/publishing skill
- CRM skill + outbound messaging skill
- platform-specific skill + browser automation fallback
- codebase understanding skill + coding skill

Avoid combining multiple skills that do the same thing unless the first one fails or lacks required coverage.

## Future skill classification procedure
For any newly downloaded skill:

1. Read only its name and description first.
2. Determine the primary user task it solves.
3. Assign exactly one primary domain and one subdomain.
4. Assign optional secondary domains if truly cross-domain.
5. Assign 1-5 capability tags.
6. Inherit the subdomain risk baseline.
7. Raise risk if description mentions sending, permissions, credentials, trading, config, services, devices, installs, or proxying.
8. Lower risk only if the skill is clearly read-only.
9. If unclear, place in Z4 temporarily and mark for review.

## Permanent operating rule
Treat this routing policy as persistent guidance for future tasks. Reuse it by default whenever deciding whether to load a skill.

## Update policy
Update this skill when one of these happens:
- a new cluster of downloaded skills appears
- a subdomain becomes crowded and needs splitting
- a skill was misrouted in practice
- a risk baseline proved too high or too low
- recurring tasks show a better routing pattern

When updating:
1. Preserve stable top-level domains whenever possible.
2. Prefer adding or refining subdomains over restructuring the whole taxonomy.
3. Log changes in references/change-log.md.
4. If adding a new subdomain, define purpose, inclusion rule, exclusion rule, and default risk.
5. Rebuild the installed-skill index with `python3 scripts/update_skill_index.py --log` after classification changes or new skill installs.
6. Treat newly installed skills as backlog until reviewed or manually mapped.

## Maintenance workflow
Use this workflow to keep the router current:
1. When new skills are installed, rebuild the index with `python3 scripts/update_skill_index.py --log`.
2. Review newly added or backlog skills by reading only their name and description first.
3. If a skill is clearly important or likely to be used, move it from backlog into the manual mapping in `scripts/update_skill_index.py`.
4. Rebuild the index again after updating the mapping.
5. Run `python3 scripts/review_new_skills.py` to detect repeated backlog patterns that may justify a new subdomain.
6. Keep `references/change-log.md` short and append-only.

## Usage tracking
Track skill frequency over time using local/private governance mechanisms if desired.
In the public package, treat usage tracking as a recommended practice rather than a bundled capability.
Use frequency as a prioritization signal for backlog classification: high-use backlog-adjacent domains should be reviewed first.

## Taxonomy expansion rule
Do not force every new skill into an ill-fitting old bucket.
When newly added skills repeatedly:
- land in backlog,
- match existing subdomains only weakly,
- or form a recurring theme not well represented,
then create or split a subdomain.

## Backlog prioritization
Do not work backlog in arbitrary order.
Prioritize formal classification for skills that are:
- actually used in real tasks,
- likely to appear often,
- action-capable or higher-risk,
- or part of a repeated backlog cluster.

## Overlap detection and fusion
When new skills arrive, check for overlap before treating every skill as independent.
Two safe automation layers are allowed:
1. Routing/index fusion: detect likely duplicates/variants and prefer one canonical skill by default.
2. Canonical-first index view: keep overlapping variants on disk, but de-prioritize them in routing.

Do NOT do destructive file/content merges automatically.
If overlapping skills contain materially different instructions, scripts, or design choices, ask the user before any content-level merge.

## Download intake workflow
Use a temporary intake stage for newly downloaded skills rather than granting them immediate trust.

Rules:
- Downloading a skill does not make it trusted.
- Newly downloaded skills should be reviewed before they influence routing priority.
- Before downloading a new skill, check the existing organized/classified skill set to avoid redundant downloads and unnecessary overlap.
- New-skill risk operations still require explicit user approval.
- The public package does not bundle any downloader, logger, or cleanup scripts; implement those locally if needed.

## External risk signals
When available, use external risk/security signals to speed up review:
- If a ClawHub page exposes security or risk labeling, incorporate that signal into review priority.
- If a skill comes from outside ClawHub or through a manual copy/import path, proactively screen it before giving it routing priority.
- Treat non-ClawHub skills as needing more active review than registry-installed skills.

## Files in this skill
- `references/change-log.md`: compact history of taxonomy/index changes
- `references/skill-classification-schema.md`: schema/checklist for classification decisions

## Public package note
This public package intentionally ships the routing taxonomy, review rules, and classification schema as a lightweight policy-only governance skill.
It does not bundle local automation scripts, local indexes, intake state, persistent logging/telemetry code, overlap reports, or destructive/host-specific helpers.
Use local/private extensions if you need heavier automation in a specific host environment.

## Output format for future routing decisions
When useful, summarize chosen routing in this compact form:
- intent:
- primary domain/subdomain:
- candidate skills:
- chosen skill(s):
- risk level:
- why this choice:
- why others were not loaded:

## Boundaries
- Do not load a high-risk skill when a lower-risk path can complete the task.
- Do not treat installation/update skills as defaults.
- Do not let broad agent or meta skills overshadow narrow purpose-built skills.
- Do not permanently trust unreviewed new skills; classify them first.
- Do not allow newly downloaded skills to perform risk operations unless the user explicitly agrees.
- Treat new-skill risk operations as blocked by default for system/config/service/cron/credential/network-changing actions, even if the skill claims to automate them.
