# 📝 Summarize Pro — Enhanced Document Summarizer

> One tool for every summarization need — from bullet points to timelines.

## ❓ FAQ

### What summary modes are available?
Eight modes covering all scenarios: `summarize` (default), `bullet` (key points), `executive` (decision-maker brief), `chapter` (section breakdown), `compare` (multi-doc), `translate-summary` (translate + summarize), `action` (action items), `timeline` (chronological events).

### How do I use it?
Run `bash scripts/summarize.sh <command> [text]` or let the Agent pick the right command for your need.

### What's the difference between executive and summarize?
`summarize` outputs a full summary with details. `executive` targets decision-makers — highlights conclusions, impact, and recommendations in a shorter format.

### How does compare mode work?
Provide multiple text blocks separated by `---`. The tool extracts core points from each and generates a comparative analysis.

### What languages are supported?
Works with any language input. `translate-summary` can translate while summarizing in one step.
