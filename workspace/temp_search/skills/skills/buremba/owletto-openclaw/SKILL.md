# Owletto OpenClaw Setup

Use this skill when a user wants Owletto long-term memory working in OpenClaw.

## Setup Flow

1. Ensure CLI prerequisites are available.

```bash
node --version
pnpm --version
owletto --help
```

2. Install the OpenClaw plugin package.

```bash
openclaw plugins install owletto-openclaw-plugin
```

3. Log in to Owletto for MCP access.

```bash
owletto login --mcpUrl https://owletto.com/mcp
```

4. Configure OpenClaw plugin settings.

```bash
owletto configure --mcpUrl https://owletto.com/mcp/acme
```

5. Verify auth + MCP connectivity.

```bash
owletto health --mcpUrl https://owletto.com/mcp/acme
```

## Direct CLI Usage

After setup, use the CLI to interact with Owletto directly:

- `owletto mcp tools` — list available tools
- `owletto mcp call <tool> --params '<json>'` — call any tool
- `owletto token --raw` — get bearer token for scripting

Examples:
- `owletto mcp call search --params '{"query":"spotify"}'`
- `owletto mcp call save_content --params '{"entity_id":1,"content":"user prefers dark mode","metadata":{}}'`
- `owletto mcp call get_content --params '{"query":"user preferences","limit":5}'`

## Notes

- For self-hosted or non-default environments, replace `https://owletto.com/mcp/acme` with the target MCP URL.
- If `openclaw` is not on PATH, install OpenClaw CLI first, then rerun setup.
- If browser login is unavailable, complete OAuth on another machine/browser and rerun from a shell with browser access.
