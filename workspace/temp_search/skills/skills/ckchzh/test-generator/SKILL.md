# Test Generator — Automated Test Case Generation

> Generate high-quality test code in seconds, stop writing boilerplate by hand

## Why Use This?

- Writing tests is tedious → auto-generate templates, fill in business logic
- Missing edge cases → `edge` command systematically generates boundary tests
- Mock setup is verbose → standardized mock patterns, ready to copy-paste

## Command Reference

```
unit <lang> <function>       → Unit test template
integration <lang> <module>  → Integration test template
e2e <lang> <flow>            → End-to-end test flow
mock <lang> <target>         → Mock/Stub objects
fixture <lang> <type>        → Test fixtures
coverage <lang>              → Coverage config and tips
edge <type> <range>          → Edge case generation
benchmark <lang> <target>    → Performance benchmark test
```

## Supported Frameworks

| Language | Test Framework |
|----------|---------------|
| Python | pytest, unittest |
| JavaScript | Jest, Mocha, Vitest |
| Go | testing, testify |
| Bash | bats |

## Best Practice

Name tests as `test_<feature>_<scenario>_<expected>` for instant readability.
