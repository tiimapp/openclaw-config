## Rich Faculty Config

Each faculty in manifest.json is an object with optional config:

```json
{ "name": "voice", "provider": "elevenlabs", "voiceId": "...", "stability": 0.4, "similarity_boost": 0.8 }
```

Config is automatically mapped to env vars at install time. Users only need to add their API key.
